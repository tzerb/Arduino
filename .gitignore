# --- Build Artifacts and Compilation Outputs ---
# These are files generated during the build process and should not be tracked.
# The standard Arduino IDE puts these in a temporary build location, but
# other tools like PlatformIO or Arduino-Makefile might create them in
# the project directory or specific build folders.
build/
*.bin
*.elf
*.hex
*.lst
*.map
*.eep
*.sym
*.o
*.d
*.su

# --- IDE and Editor Specific Files ---
# Various development environments create hidden or temporary files for
# internal settings, workspace management, or caching. These are personal
# to your local setup and should not be shared across different machines
# or collaborators.
# Arduino IDE 1.x and 2.x files
.arduino/
.arduinocli/
arduino-ide-log.txt
*.lss

# VS Code specific files (if you use the Arduino or PlatformIO extensions)
.vscode/
.cache/
.tode/
.ino.uso
.vc.db
*.vsarduino.h
.ion/

# PlatformIO specific files (if using PlatformIO)
.pio/
.pioenvs/
.piolibs/

# Atmel Studio / Visual Micro specific files
_vm/
*.aps
*.user
*.configuser
*.cproj.user

# General OS and Editor files
.DS_Store # macOS specific file for folder settings
Thumbs.db # Windows specific file for image thumbnails
ehthumbs.db # Windows
.directory # Linux/KDE specific file
*.swp # Vim swap files
*~ # Backup files created by many text editors

# --- Project-Specific Configuration Files ---
# Configuration files generated automatically that do not belong in version control.
# `sdkconfig` is an example for ESP32 projects which is often generated from
# a default but should not be committed if it changes frequently during builds.
sdkconfig
sdkconfig.old
# For library development, sometimes example passwords need ignoring
passwords.h

# --- Other potentially ignored files ---
# Depending on your specific workflow, you might also want to ignore:
# Libraries you download manually (if using Git submodules or PlatformIO for management instead)
# lib/
# libraries/

# Executable binaries if you are building CLI tools alongside your project
# *.exe
